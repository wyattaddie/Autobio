                I can't believe Im turning 35 in a month. It has been some very fun and productive years. I remember in grade 6 when a pandemic happened. It was awful, when it started I remember thinking Right now its across the world we have nothing to worry about. I was wrong, a few months later were all in lockdown, we had to wear masks, we couldnt see family. It really put the whole world on pause. We then knew were going to be in this for a while. My mom came up to my brother and I one day and said, Were going to be in this for a while so I think it would be a good thing if we all pick up some new hobbies. She went on to suggest playing guitar, speaking Spanish, or learning to code. All of these interested me, but there was one in particular. Learning to code. So that night I went on this website called Khan Academy and I started, and I didnt want to stop. It was then I learned what I wanted to do when I got older.

I went on to study circuit boards and learned 8 different coding languages throughout grade 6,7, and 8. By the time I was graduating grade 8, I had made so many inventions with circuit boards I was wondering how I could take this to the next level. So all through high school I focused on getting good grades and taking classes that could help me improve my skills and get into a good university. I had my eyes set on going to Queens University and getting my Bachelors degree in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering. So I had to work hard. I stayed up late studying night after night. It was hard, but it was all worth it. One night I was in my room coding when I got an email that was from Queens university. Suddenly my heart started racing, I became very tense. This is it. I said, Everything Ive done came down to this moment. I started reading. Dear Mr. Addie, we are excited to tell you we loved your application and we would love for you to come and be a part of our Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering program. It happened, all of my hard work had finally paid off. I went on to get my bachelors degree. 

My original plan for after university was to get a job where I can make robots and thats exactly what I did, but little did I know in a few years I would quit my job and start my own business and build robots. And thats what I did for a few years and I would sell circuit boards I made and thats how I would make money. Over time I started hiring people to help expand my business and we became a very big company called Circuits Co. We even have a website, www.CircuitsCo.com. I am now the Ceo of a company that makes robots that are on the International Space Station and robots that helped cure cancer.

I dont just work all day every day. I have fun all the time, for example almost every saturday I spend golfing with my friend I met in Joseph Gould, Chase. We will sometimes play golf with another one of my friends Ive known for countless years, Aidan. We play 18 holes every time. Sometimes we decide after 18 holes we want to play another 18 holes so we do. And because I am the CEO of CircuitsCo if I want or dont want to come in any day I can. So golf will never interfere with my job.


Even when times were tough like when I had just started my business and it wasnt going too well my family has always been there for me no matter what. Without them I dont know if I would have the multi-million dollar business I do today. So out of everything that I have, the thing I am most grateful for having is my family

It has been a crazy couple of years, but I feel good with what I have accomplished and I have some big plans for the future. I am planning to expand my company world wide but thats a story Ill tell in another 35 years.
